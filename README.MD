### Technologies Used: 
1. Javascript

### Future Plans For The Game:
- I plan to add seven more categories to the game to give whoever plays the game more options to pick from.
- I plan to go more in depth with the fun facts that are given, for instance if the user gets the question true it will explain more about the subject at hand. If the user gets the fun fact incorrect it will say what the correct answer is. 
- I will add difficulty levels to the game.
- I will add audio functions on all of the category buttons.
